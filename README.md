## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hello everyone, I'm Kraits, as I already wrote in the description in my profile, I like to do all sorts of different things, for example, digging Android or Windows (it became uninteresting, I abandoned it)
I like to make magisk modules and other stuff
# My devices:
- **Redmi Note 4X 3/32 (Gray):** A good phone even today, it has a custom firmware crDroid 7.0
- **Redmi Note 4X 3/32 (Gold):** Exactly the same phone as that one, but this one has a swollen battery. It has Miui 9
- **Infinix HOT 30i 8/128 (Mirror Black):** My main phone, the phone is not good, but not bad either, so to speak, a balance. At the moment, there is Pixel Experience on Android 12.
I also have 6 more phones, but there is no point in describing them because they are too old
